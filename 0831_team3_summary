# Summary: Incident Management

Incident is an unplanned interruption of a service, or reduction in the quality of a service. Incident aka failure 
can occur at any time and can take in the form of Hardware failure, Software updates, Configuration changes, 
Accidental events or Malicious attacks.

An IM plan clearly describes the issue on how it is detected or who manually triggered the incident, date and time the 
incident was reported, description of incident, incident category and level of incident.

Levels of incident ranges from Severity Level SEV1 to SEV4 where SEV1 is the most critical. For SEV1, an example is
when functionality is severely disrupted and is violating SLAs.

When an incident is bigger than the team, it is easy for multiple teams to be working redundantly or at cross purposes.
So, it requires higher level of communication, control and coordination whereby it needs to be escalated to experienced 
Incident Commander. Long running incidents may also require handoff to teams across time zones as work progresses.

IM is a structured approach to incident response adapted from Incident Command System. It is used by emergency 
response organizations for natural disasters. It provides a clear and scalable process and provides clear roles and 
responsibilities. It enhances control, coordination and communication. It is impt because major incidents are 
costly (approx $100k-$300k/h), can lead to loss of customer confidence and regulatory penalties. A Well defined and 
rehearsed IM Process will ensure faster incident resolution (MTTR = Mean time to restore, repair, respond or recovery).
There will be reduced costs or revenue loss, improved internal/external communications and continuous improvement 
and learning.

An IM Process is as such:
1. Identify key roles and clear chain of command
2. Define responsibilities
3. Capture response efforts for future analysis and learning
4. Communicate

Benefits of IM Planning include clearly defining a chain of command, everyone involved having a single person to 
report to, defined communications channels for clear and rapid communication, having a systematic procedure to follow,
clear focus on recovery of the business capabilities While capturing data for continuous improvement.

An Incident Commander (IC) can adjust the organization accordingly. Increased complexity means responsibilities 
may need to be delegated among Scribe, Communications Lead, Operations Lead and Planning Lead. 

Incident Action Planning is as such:
1. Cover a specified timeframe
2. Be proactive towards resolving (Specify incident objectives and State the activities to be completed)
3. Assign responsibilities (Identify needed resources)

There needs to be clear communications. Possible solutions are instant messaging channel, conferencing bridge or 
other audio/visual collaboration environment, shared folders, SharePoint documents or other collaboration for 
documentation and information sharing.

Key resource management activities include resource identification, adding subject matter experts to the 
response team, planning for additional physical or cloud-based IT resources.

Accountability is important. Need to clearly identify each role. Response operations need to be coordinated as 
directed by the IC. There should be no heroic independent efforts. Changes to the normal operations of the 
business should be tracked and followed-up. Span of Control monitored to adequately supervise areas.

For Functional Area, 
Incident Command: Objectives, Strategies, Priorities, Overall responsibility
Communications: Coordinates internal and external comms, Formulates messages, Updates comms channels
Operations: Arranges for resources and needed services, Directs all operations resources
Planning: Tracking system changes, Collecting/analyzing info, Documenting follow-up tasks.

IC is responsible for overall coordination, keeps incident moving towards resolution, coordinates other roles, 
delegates tasks and should not be personally making changes. This is the only role that is always filled. He 
maintains documentation of incident since it is critical to keep track of what has already been done and 
necessary for lessons learned analysis. He ensures the overall stability of the system throughout the response.
He provides info to internal and external stakeholders, like executive suites, customers, and regulatory agencies.
He establishes and maintains liaison with third-party and oversights agencies participating in incident 
response.

When it comes to selecting/changing ICs, Selecting: Self-designated initial IC and IC On-Call.
Changing: Qualified IC assumes command (e.g., the individual who discovered the incident accepts the IC role until an 
on-call IC can join the response team). Incident changes in complexity. Current IC needs to rest, on long or 
extended incident so rotation is required. The organization is set up to follow the sun through different time zones 
and the end of the current workday is approaching.

Scribe assists IC - Captures comm, actions and discussion from conference bridge. He uses visible comm tool like 
Chatroom (Slack/Teams/etc) or Google docs. He also focuses on capturing all info for future use. It is impt to capture 
info during the incident response efforts so that there is sufficient detail to allow analysis of the response during 
postmortem. It should not be sanitized and not be edited to make the response appear better.

Operations Lead (OL) works with IC. He develops theories on what is broken and why, recommends changes to IC and
coordinates the operation team's efforts to restore the service. He makes sure that changes are made in a controlled 
manner and that only operation teams are making changes to the system. He brings in subject matter experts (SMEs) to 
assist.

Communications Lead is responsible for comms, internal and external, periodic updates like status page, social media
and direct comm. He may be delegated to maintain incident documentation like comm and post incident analysis.

Planning Lead Supports OL and IC. He captures long-term issues, creates tickets, arranges handoffs, tracks system 
divergence from SLO and supports Operations teams.

Service-Specific Subject Matter Expert (SME) are usually called in to advise on service-specific knowledge and
are not normally involved in operations. SME On-Call familiarizes with the other roles. He joins the incident 
comms channel ASAP, offers theories and suggestions where support decisions are made by IC, focuses on resolving the 
incident and leaves the incident channel when necessary.

To know when to deal with an incident, note these 3:
1. Requires immediate and dedicated effort to resolve - Determine incident level and impact
2. Deal with incident ASAP when - SLI indicates current or imminent failure to meet SLO, Customer complaint
3. Declare incident immediately, unless fix is obvious and easy

It is important to identify impacts. Who and how many are impacted, Service unavailable (Consider dependencies),
SLO/SLA in violation, Monetary (Loss of income, Penalties, Fines), Regulatory (Legal risk, Loss of license/permit to 
operate, Criminal risk).

Incident Cycle is: Identify > Diagnose > Stabilize > Verify > (cycle repeats)

Incident Response Behavior: May deviate from normal operations, Normal seniority is not applied, Response team is 
ultimate authority, IC must be consensus when can but always decisive, Tensions are high, Do not take it personally

When closing the incident, it is impt to communicate. Ensure that the person who filed the incident is satisfied 
that it is fixed. Preventive measures like what cause(s) can be eliminated. Key indicators to monitor for prevention 
or early notice of future incidents. Documentation needs to be available for future reference in case of future 
incidents. Postmortem for what was learned.

In Enterprise Command Center (ECC), questions to be asked:
Why are we here? Do we have everyone we need? What's the problem? What can't they do? What's been identified?
What fixes are recommended? Are we working? Does everyone know what they did and when? Here in ECC, IC role changes
to reduced Enterprise Authority, Resides with ECC. IC now assists in Strategic Planning and is no longer responsible 
for strategy and stays on comm to ECC.

Benefits of Unified Command are unified efforts across multiple teams, one voice in communicating (Customers, 
Public), Executives, Emphasized urgency and Handle conflicting goals.
