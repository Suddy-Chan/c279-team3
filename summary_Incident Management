Incident Management:
Raising Incident -> Fixing -> Response Team -> Resolve
Failure Form: 
Hardware failure, Software updates, Configuration changes, Accidental events, Malicious attacks
Level of incident:
SEV1: A critical disruption to the business that requires public notification and coordination with the executive teams.
SEV2: A major incident with significant impact on customers' ability to use the service
SEV3: A minor incident with low impact that require immediate attention
SEV4: A minor issue with no impact on the customers' ability to use the service
Incident management:
• Structured approach to incident response
• Adapted from Incident Command System
    Used by emergency response organizations for natural disasters
    Provides a clear and scalable process
    Provides clear roles and responsibilities 
• Enhances
    Control
    Coordination
    Communication
Major incidents are costly
• $100000 - $300000 / hour or more • Loss of customer confidence
• Regulatory penalties
Well defined and rehearsed Incident Management Process
• Faster incident resolution (MTTR = Mean time to restore, repair, respond or recovery)
• Reduced costs and/or revenue loss
• Improved internal/external communications
• Continuous improvement and learning
Incident Management Process
1. Identify key roles and clear chain of command
2. Define responsibilities
3. Capture response efforts for future analysis and learning
4. Communicate
Making Incident Management Work
Faster Incident Resolutions
    < MTTR
• Reduced losses
• Improved Communications
• Continuous Improvement
    > MTTF
    Learn from failures
Modular Organization
• Incident Commander can adjust as needed
• Increased complexity means responsibilities may need to be delegated
    Scribe, Communications Lead, Operations Lead, Planning Lead
Management by Objectives
Establish measurable objectives for the response: Strategies, Tactics, Tasks, Activities
Issue assignments in a specific and timeboxed manner: Specify who, When
Monitoring the results of the incident tasks
Incident Action Planning
 1 Cover a specified timeframe
 2 Be proactive towards resolving
    • Specify the incident objectives
    • State the activities to be completed
 3 Assign responsibilities
    • Identify needed resources
Clear communication: Instant messaging channel, Conferencing bridge or other audio/visual collaboration environment, haredfolders,SharePoint documents or other collaboration for documentation and information sharing.
Key resource management activities include:
Resource identification, Adding subject matter experts to the response team, Planning for additional physical or cloud-based IT resources
Establishing and Transferring Command:
Incident Commander is the first role filled 
• Self-designated
• Assigned
Relieving existing Incident Commander 
• Expertise
• Endurance
Functional Areas: Command, Communications, Operations, Planning
Incident Command 
• Objectives
• Strategies
• Priorities
• Overall responsibility
Communications
• Coordinates internal and external communications
• Formulates messages
• Updates communications channels
Operations
• Arranges for resources and needed services
• Directs all operations resources
Planning
• Tracking system changes
• Collecting/analyzing information 
• Documenting follow-up tasks
Incident Commander
Responsible for overall coordination
• Keeps incident moving towards resolution
Coordinates all the other roles
• De facto holder of any roles not delegated to others
Delegates tasks
• Should not be personally making changes
Only role always filled
Scribe
Assists IC
• Capturescommunication
• Capturesactions
• Capturesdiscussionfrom conference bridge
Use visible communication tool
• Chatroom(Slack/Teams/etc)
• Googledocs
Focus on capturing all information for future use
Transfer of Command Discussion
Always include a thorough transfer of command briefing
Notify the rest of the incident response team
What would you include in a transfer of command briefing
Incident Management Checklist
Acknowledge the incident
 Initialize internal and external communications channels
Research the issue
 Triage for scope and severity
 Make initial diagnosis
 Localized or other systems impacted  Dependencies
Fixable/Escalate
 Check for existing playbook to handle 
 Is a fix automated already
 Identify who is needed to fix
 Estimate scope in time and resources 
 Gather information
    To assist the next level when escalated 
    To be reviewed in the postmortem
Root cause analysis
Document
 Follow-up task tickets 
 Close the incident
Benefits of Unified Command
• Unified efforts
    Across multiple teams
• One voice in communicating
    Customers
    Public
• Executives
• Emphasized urgency
• Handle conflicting goals



Postmortems:
An incident postmortem brings people together to discuss the details of an incident: 
Why it happened, impact, actions taken to mitigated it and resolve it, follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring
part of the incident response is to detect, respond, resolve, learn
Blameless postmortem: 
Post-project meeting in which you review problems to learn why they happened and prevent reoccurrence
- No finger-pointing and no blame games
- Focus on improving performance moving forward and proactively preventing the incident

Embracing Risk, Feedback and Fatigue

Incident occurrs: Prepare and Plan for them (Before incident); Practice response procedures (After incident)
Error Budgets: Change Velocity
Opportunity for improvement: Avoid heroics; On-call rotation 

Continuous Improvement: 
Automation: manual tasks vs toil; automation is not automatic (Not all toil should be automated)
Documentation: needs to be kept updated, eg: postmortems, engineered improvements, better procedures, correction discovered during practice
Reducing Toil: 
- Tasks that are toil don’t provide a lot of value. Rather, they keep engineers from progressing with product and service development.
- If teams spend the majority of their time on these tasks, they have less time for high-value work. This prohibits innovation.
- Benefits of reducing toil: 
    Time freed up can be saved and reinvested.
    Prevent future toil from emerging. In that sense, it’s a positive spiral.
Update SLO 
Important to consider when Service Level Objectives need to be adjusted 
 - might be up or down 
 - focus on business expectations 
 - customer satisfaction
Update Monitoring/SLI
 - Better Service Level Indicators identified 
 - More accurate alerting 
 - Better warning of pending incidents 
Update Alerts 
 - Eliminate false positives
 - Improve information that accompanies alert
 - Point to likely resources for faster fix
 - Assign some alerts to automate ticket generation
 - Focus on those that need immediate human intervention
Failure - when, not if 
Complexity of system guarantees hardware failure: Cloud 
Security attacks: Organization may or may not know they have been attacked
Database corruption
Component update: Behave unexpectedly; Google: 70% of failures are due to component/configuration change
Response to Failure: Accept that failure will happen: Plan, Learn, Practice
On-call Rotation: Hard to provide 24/7 service availability; Is the support centralized or global; Heroics: attraction of acclaim for saving the data, set expectations, burnout
Alert Fatigue: Common when systems are at an edge point; alerts have self-heal cycles, monitoring cycles repeatedly alert the same issue, false positive alert; Often leads to ignored alerts: will self-heal, think it is not really an issue; too many alerts
