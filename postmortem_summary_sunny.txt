Postmortems
- Part of the incident response process
- Detect, Respond, Resolve, LEARN
- SRE definition: a written report of an incident, including:
    - its impacts
    - the actions taken to mitigate or resolve it
    - the root cause(s)
    - the follow-up actions to prevent it from recurring

Objectives of postmortems
- failure is an opportunity for improvement
- learn what went wrong and went right
- practice follow-up actions

To blame or not to blame
- It's not the person that failed, but it's the system that failed
- So we should focus on the system to make a repeat failure less likely

Blameless postmortem process
- Embrace risk: learn from mistakes rather than successes
- Capture information during incident response efforts
- Focus on preventing incidents
- Use standard format for reports

Problem statement and Impact statement
- Problem statement: 
    - What was the problem?
    - What lead to the problem?
    - What were the unexpected results due to changes to the system?
    - Why did the incident happen?
- Impact statement:
    - What was the impact?
    - Who was impacted? (Internal and External)
    - % of customers impacted
    - How much income lost
    - Regulatory or legal consequences

Timeline
- a timeline should list all tasks done during recovery
- also includes Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) 

Root cause(s)
- To prevent reoccurance, focus on root causes, not proximate cause

Corrective actions
- Tasks and actions to be done: Deadlines, Assignment of responsibility, Follow-up
- May need to be manual; May be referred to the development team

Sharing of postmortems
- Since the purpose of postmortem is to learn, postmortem must be shared, easily located in the next emergency
  and need supporting documents that need to be shared

Blameless culture
- Sharing postmortem reports
- Practice blameless postmortems
    - Postmortem challenges
    - Review reports
- Award and Recognition
    - Incentives for sharing failures
