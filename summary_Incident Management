• Structured approach to incident response
• Adapted from Incident Command System
    Used by emergency response organizations for natural disasters
    Provides a clear and scalable process
    Provides clear roles and responsibilities 
• Enhances
    Control
    Coordination
    Communication
Major incidents are costly
• $100000 - $300000 / hour or more • Loss of customer confidence
• Regulatory penalties
Well defined and rehearsed Incident Management Process
• Faster incident resolution (MTTR = Mean time to restore, repair, respond or recovery)
• Reduced costs and/or revenue loss
• Improved internal/external communications
• Continuous improvement and learning
Incident Management Process
1. Identify key roles and clear chain of command
2. Define responsibilities
3. Capture response efforts for future analysis and learning
4. Communicate
Making Incident Management Work
Faster Incident Resolutions
    < MTTR
• Reduced losses
• Improved Communications
• Continuous Improvement
    > MTTF
    Learn from failures
Modular Organization
• Incident Commander can adjust as needed
• Increased complexity means responsibilities may need to be delegated
    Scribe, Communications Lead, Operations Lead, Planning Lead
Management by Objectives
Establish measurable objectives for the response: Strategies, Tactics, Tasks, Activities
Issue assignments in a specific and timeboxed manner: Specify who, When
Monitoring the results of the incident tasks
