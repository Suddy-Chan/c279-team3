Exercise: Distributed Tracing

Your Task: Based on these limiting facts and with no access to the system, give your ideas of where you think the issue is and what it might be. Organise your ideas in the priority of which you think most likely.


1. One main issue could be the update to the Lambda functions in recent releases last night. As the problem only happens today since 10:00 am after the update changes.
2. Another issue could be the symbol data from NoSQL database because it only has stocks beginning with A - F, N - R from 9.30am and stocks starting with other letters are missed from 9:30. 



Summary: Observability

APM: Application performance monitoring 
1. logs: record of past events 
2. metrics: current data  
3. traces:capture activity for a business transaction;show interactivity in complex sysytems
